# Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio website that showcase my skills and projects that I built.

I built this website using react and nextjs with tailwind for css.

I learned a lot by building this portfolio. Mainly because this is my first time using nextjs. I used vite before this project. I learned how app router, server component, client component and how nextjs process.
